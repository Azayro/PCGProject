# PCGProject

Welcome to my Procedural Content Generation project.

I've always had an interest on how the vast worlds in games are made and populated with busy villages and beautiful scenary.
The aim of this project is to generate a 'world' with the click of a button, filled with content; villages, trees, foliage, rivers, pathways, caves etc.
